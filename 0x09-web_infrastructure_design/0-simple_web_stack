Specifics

-What is a Server:
A server is a machine or software that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

-Role of the Domain Name:
A domain name (www.foobar.com) serves as a human-friendly label for the server's IP address, making it easier for users to access the website.

-Type of DNS Record for www in www.foobar.com:
The DNS record for www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which points to the domain's canonical (official) name.

-Role of the Web Server (Nginx):
Nginx acts as the entry point for HTTP requests, forwarding them to the application server.
Handles static content and can improve performance with features like caching and load balancing.

-Role of the Application Server:
Executes dynamic application code in response to user requests.
Communicates with the web server to generate and serve dynamic content.

-Role of the Database (MySQL):
Stores and manages structured data for the website.
Provides a structured way to retrieve, update, and manage the website's information.

-Server Communication with User's Computer:
The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols to exchange data and deliver the requested web pages.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

-Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If it fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

-Downtime during Maintenance:
Deploying new code may require restarting the web server, causing downtime during the restart process.

-Scaling Limitations:
The infrastructure may struggle to handle increased traffic. Scaling is limited to the capabilities of a single server.


Recommendations for Improvement:

-High Availability:
Introduce redundancy and failover mechanisms to eliminate the single point of failure. Consider load balancing.

-Deployments without Downtime:
Implement strategies like rolling deployments or blue-green deployments to update the application without causing downtime.

-Horizontal Scaling:
Explore options for horizontal scaling by adding more servers to distribute the load and accommodate increased traffic.
